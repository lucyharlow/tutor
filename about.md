I believe in a holistic and enriching education, led by curiosity and compassion, centering the interests of the individual and promoting synthesis across disciplines.

The classroom teaches us important things, but it also urges us to compartmentalise our knowledge and to specialise early. This is convenient and efficient for institutions, but it can be stultifying for the intellect.
