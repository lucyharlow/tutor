I read English as an undergraduate at the **University of St Andrews**, and received a first-class MA (Hons) in 2009. I also held piano and organ scholarships, enabling me to continue my musical studies, and received summer funding from the Undergraduate Research Internship Programme to carry out advanced research. 

I continued my studies at the **University of York**, achieving a high distinction in my MA in Renaissance Literature, along with the Philip Brockbank prize for best dissertation. I also received funding from the F. R. Leavis fund and the Herzog August Bibliothek to carry out research in Wolfenbüttel, Germany.



I then moved to the USA to enrol in the English Ph.D. program at **Princeton University**, supported by a graduate fellowship and a semester of funding from the Folger Shakespeare Library. I completed my dissertation and was awarded my doctorate in 2019.
