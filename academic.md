I read **English** at the **University of St Andrews**, graduating with a first-class MA (Hons) in 2009. I held piano and organ scholarships throughout my degree, enabling me to continue my musical studies and perform regularly. I received summer funding from the Undergraduate Research Internship Programme to carry out advanced research in Old English poetry and literary theory.

I continued my studies at the **University of York**, achieving a high distinction in my MA in **Renaissance Literature**, along with the Philip Brockbank prize for best dissertation. I also received funding from the F. R. Leavis fund and the Herzog August Bibliothek, in order to attend a summer course in Wolfenbüttel, Germany.

I then moved to the USA to enrol in the **English** Ph.D. program at **Princeton University**, supported by a graduate fellowship and a semester of funding from the Folger Shakespeare Library. I completed my dissertation and was awarded my doctorate in 2019.

In addition to my degree level study, I completed the six-month **novel-writing course** with **Curtis Brown Creative**, and wrote my first novel, a work of literary fiction about a violinist going through a mental health crisis. I have a postgraduate certificate in **Psychology** from **Oxford Brookes University**, and I'm a mental health first aider. I have a clear DBS check from November 2025.
