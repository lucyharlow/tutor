      Teaching Experience
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I have many years’ teaching experience, specialising in English language and literature, creative writing, and music. However, I have an unusually diverse range of interests and expertise beyond these areas! I’m able to synthesise my many fields of knowledge and draw on them imaginatively to connect with students.</p>

<h3 id="english-literature">English Literature</h3>

<p>As a Ph.D. student at Princeton University, I worked as an Assistant Instructor in the English department, regularly teaching small groups of undergraduates. This involved in-depth discussion of literary texts, as well as writing and close-reading exercises. I held regular office hours, providing one-on-one academic and pastoral support. I received consistently high teaching evaluations from my students - they often mentioned my passion for what I taught and evident care for the wellbeing of everyone in the class.</p>

<p>After completing my doctorate I was a visiting lecturer at Roehampton University, where I designed and taught a module on children’s literature. I also supervised a variety of undergraduate dissertations in the English department.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>

<p>I’m an accomplished musician, having worked professionally for many years as a pianist, organist, and singer. I also play the violin and guitar. As a music teacher, I have successfully prepared students aged 8-18 for ABRSM exams in music theory and piano performance. I have many years’ experience directing choirs for children and adults, and teaching the fundamentals of singing and theory.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>I have black belts in ITF taekwondo and Korean kickboxing, and I successfully completed the coaching apprenticeship with Rising Spirit Academy, Oxford. I have experience assisting the children’s martial arts classes, providing technical guidance and encouragement to children aged 4-12.</p>

<p>I am currently working towards a qualification in yoga teaching with Every Body Studio.</p>
