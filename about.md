As a tutor I specialise in English language and literature, creative writing, and music. However, I have an unusually diverse range of interests and expertise beyond this! I'm driven by compassion and curiosity, and consider myself a multipotentialite. I'm able to synthesise my many areas of knowledge and draw on them imaginatively to connect with students.
