I provide tutoring primarily in **literature**, **creative writing**, and **music**, usually from ages 8 and up, though I'm always happy to consider taking on younger children.

I can help with all kinds of writing, whether creative or critical; I can also help to prepare students for exams, such as GCSE and A Level English and Music, and ABRSM grade 5 theory. In addition I can provide enrichment sessions tailored to the interests of the individual student. Please see my [about](/about/) and [experience](/experience/) sections to get a sense of how broad my own interests are!


My rate for private tutoring and mentoring is **£50 per hour**. I offer discounts for block bookings paid in advance. Please enquire for more details.



I'm delighted to offer a one-off <strong>free half-hour consultation</strong> to all new clients, either in person or online, to discuss learning goals and get to know each other before committing to further sessions.



Please don't hesitate to contact me by [email](mailto:lucy@lucyharlow.com) or [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/447548346221) to arrange your first session!
