As a music teacher, I have successfully prepared students aged 8-18 for ABRSM exams in music theory and piano performance. I have many years' experience directing choirs for children and adults, and teaching the fundamentals of singing and theory. 



At Princeton I worked as an Assistant Instructor in the English department, regularly teaching small groups of undergraduates. This involved in-depth discussion of literary texts, as well as writing and close-reading exercises. I also held regular office hours, providing one-on-one academic and pastoral support. I received consistently high teaching evaluations from my students - they often mentioned my passion for what I taught and evident care for the wellbeing of everyone in the class. When I moved back to the UK I designed and taught a module on children's literature at Roehampton University, and individually supervised a variety of undergraduate dissertations.
