 I have a first-class MA (Hons) from the University of St Andrews, where I also held piano and organ scholarships and received summer funding from the Undergraduate Research Internship Programme. I continued my studies at the University of York, achieving a high distinction in my MA in Renaissance Literature, along with the Philip Brockbank prize for best dissertation. I also received funding from the F. R. Leavis fund and the Herzog August Bibliothek to carry out research in Wolfenbüttel, Germany.

I then moved to the USA to enrol in the English Ph.D. program at Princeton University, supported by a graduate fellowship and a semester of funding from the Folger Shakespeare Library. I completed my dissertation and was awarded my doctorate in 2019.
